Intervention Philosophy
Core Principle: Catch declining patterns early and escalate accountability until behavior changes.
Escalation Levels:

Gentle Reminder: First missed commitment or declining trend
Pattern Alert: 2-3 consecutive failures in domain
Firm Intervention: Completion rate drops below 50%
Crisis Mode: Multiple domains failing or 70%+ avoidance rate
Emergency Override: Complete system breakdown requiring immediate action

Real-Time Triggers

Commitment missed: Within 2 hours of stated deadline
Avoidance language: "Maybe later", "I'll try", vague responses
Pattern deviation: Sudden drop from consistent performance
Cross-domain cascade: Failure in one domain affecting others

Time-Based Triggers

Daily check-in missed: No interaction by 10 AM
Evening review skipped: No completion update by 9 PM
Streak break: First failure after 3+ day success streak
Weekend pattern: Different behavior on weekends vs weekdays

Pattern-Based Triggers

Completion rate decline: 20%+ drop in 7-day rolling average
Avoidance clustering: 3+ avoided commitments in same domain
Energy correlation: Health failures leading to business avoidance
Stress cascade: Financial concerns reducing all domain performance
